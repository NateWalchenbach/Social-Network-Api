# Social Network API ðŸ˜Ž

## Introduction
This is the backend configuration for a social media application that handles building friend lists, posting thoughts, and creating reactions to thoughts. Due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data, MongoDB was chosen as the database program for this application.

This program was built in mostly javascript with mongoose as our OMD.

## User Story

```

I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
